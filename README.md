# Machine Learning : Drawing Recognition 

#### This project is a Js machine learning project That simulate the Quick Draw game. The players will draw doodles, and the artificial intelligence will attempt to guess the objects represented by the drawings


## Technologies Used

- The game is made in HTML5 using Phaser 2 framework and TensorFlow.js library for machine learning.

- To classify images, I implemented an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on Machine Learning (ML) 

- The model was trained on a small subset of the Quick Draw Dataset.
